# HW1: Verilog Simulation Project
Overview
This project was developed as part of the HW1 assignment for the Electrical and Computer Engineering course in the 7th semester. The goal of this project is to design, implement, and simulate a digital system using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The simulation and testing of the Verilog code were carried out using Icarus Verilog and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment.
